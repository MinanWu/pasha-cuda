# Pasha: Parallel Algorithms for Small Hitting Set Approximations

**Pasha** (Parallel Algorithms for Small Hitting Set Approximations) is a tool for finding approximations for a small universal hitting set (a small set of k-mers that hits every sequence of length L). A detailed description of the functionality of Pasha, along with results in set size, runtime, memory usage and CPU utilization are provided in:

> Ekim, B., Orenstein, Y., Berger, B. Parallel algorithms for small hitting set approximations. *19th International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics* (2019).

## Installation and setup

Pasha takes the k-mer length k, the sequence length L, and the approximation constants epsilon and delta as input, and outputs a compact universal hitting set of k-mers.
